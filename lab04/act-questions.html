Pick some values of X and run both programs from the last two activities. For the restricted version, use a subset size of 3. Plot the numbers on a graph. You can use the provided steps to generate the jpeg image file of the graph or you may use any other program to plot your data (as long as you generate a jpeg file of your graph and call the file data.jpg).

When testing your programs for this activity you should run between 6-9 tests for each of the programs, ranging the set size from 4-25 to get a reasonable graph.

Briefly state your impressions of your results. Were they what you expected?
They were what I expected. Because Knapsack requires you to check every possible subset, its growth rate would increase at a much faster rate than KnapsackN would, which the graph does show.
