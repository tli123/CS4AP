1. Assignment Feedback
----------------------
a) What did you learn by doing this assignment?
I learned that I read things way too fast and need to read
everything carefully before proceeding. I learned the importance
of carefully documenting everything so it was readable, as well as
organizing all the methods into different classes for easier 
understanding of the code.

----------------------
b) What was easy about this assignment?
The game itself wasn't hard to code at all. The rules were quite
simple, and there are no complex circumstances during any player's
turn.

----------------------
c) What was harder than you originally thought?
The implemnetation of the players. I originally thought that we were
allowed to put if statements into the main method saying 
if player == bad:
    badAlgorithm();
But when I learned we had to do it another way, inheritance was the only
thing that came to mind, but I forgot most of my inheritance. So I was forced
to relearn it.

----------------------
d) What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?
The instructor could specify in the assignment about the use of 
polymorphism, so someone like me who finished the code before he
announced it in class doesn't have to completely revamp. Otherwise,
the assignment was fine.

----------------------
e) What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
The assignment was fine, but having a bit of freedom in our code
would have been preferred. Everything had to have a specific output,
probably for grading purposes, but restricts our creativity.

----------------------
f) What other issues would you like to discuss?
I didn't find any other issues, honestly.
